This was a 3 person school project where we created our own custom language- by Connor Kippes, Luke Laurie, and Ryan Bullard

It has a parser and translator written in java where it translates it to python code

There are many features we included which are described in more detail in our pdf presentation and instructions pdf in the project folder
